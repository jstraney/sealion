# Code of Conduct

When you volunteer to contribute in any way to the Sealion project you are agreeing to follow our code of conduct.

The commitment to the conduct is pretty simple:

* No harassment of any kind
* No bullying (including microagressive behavior)
* No flame wars or bikeshedding
* Learn from one another

If something you said or did unintentionally has made someone uncomfortable and you do not understand why

* Do not argue with the person
* Do not beg them the question (though its okay for them to volunteer the information)
* Stop the behavior in question
* Its best practice to actually thank someone for informing you and aknowledge you will work on it
* Then, actually take time independently to learn more about issues
* If you do not think you can understand, seek help elsewhere

Violation of the code of conduction can result in permanent removal from the project and all related websites, boards and spaces.

When a violation is reported we will consider:

* Severity
* Saftey
* Frequency of Violations

When a violation is public (like in a slack channel or forum) you can expect a moderator to politely share a link to this code of conduct. Please bear in mind:

* You're not entitled to a drawn out explanation from the community
* This is not meant to be passive aggressive

# Before Escalating

It can (sometimes) be easy to infer or misread written communications.

While we are each the expert on what is acceptable or not to each of us. Sometimes it is best to follow up with these words:

"What do you mean?"

When a gross violation of conduct is apparent, you can skip this, but it may help for smaller problems and help build stronger community.

Again, most of us are here to be a part of something larger; not to cause problems.
